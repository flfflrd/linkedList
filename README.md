# linked list exercise

[video tutorial here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dti0F7w3yOQ)

This isnt finished. I was adding intuitive functionality in the insertNode function
that wasn't included in the original tutorial, and now the whole list gets jumbled.\

This program is an exercise in the use of pointers. A variable named head holds
the location in memory of the first Node. Various functions add the ability to
add a node to the start of the list, changing the head pointer and holding the
location of the next Node, as well as an int data.\
